## Welcome

Neuroscience Ph.D. and Senior Data Scientist at Scipher Medicine. I have a background in using the dynamics of neural activity in brain areas to tease apart patterns of communication, from extracellular multi-site electrophysiology data, clinical trial EEG data, and modeling/simulation/in-silico methods. I’m interested in machine learning approaches to messy time series data at scale, graph theoretic, information theoretic, and Bayesian approaches to leverage clinical utility from bioinformatic and real-world data.
