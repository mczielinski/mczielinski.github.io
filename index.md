## Welcome

Neuroscience Ph.D. and Data Scientist at Scipher Medicine. I have a background in using the dynamics of neural activity in brain areas to tease apart patterns of communication, from extracellular multi-site electrophysiology data, clinical trial EEG data, and modeling/simulation/in-silico methods. I'm interested in machine learning approaches to messy time series data at scale, graph theoretic, information theoretic, and Bayesian approaches to leverage clinical utility from bioinformatic data, and the frontiers of supervised and unsupervised learning.
